###What is this?
My Sublime Text 2 configuration. It primarily contains [C++ and Python snippets](https://github.com/ryanwersal/sublime-config/tree/master/Packages/User/Snippets) of use to me in my day-to-day job. A few things of note for others would be the minimization of the tab size and [the Emacs style key bindings](https://github.com/ryanwersal/sublime-config/blob/master/Packages/User/Default%20%28Windows%29.sublime-keymap).

###Goals/Todo
* ~~Get SublimeRope working performantly.~~
* Get SublimeClang working performantly.
* Stop committing modules controlled by Package Control.
